Our sixth community meetup has concluded successfully, bringing together cybersecurity enthusiasts for a dynamic exchange of knowledge and collaboration. Our first speaker was an esteemed APU Senior Lecturer specializing in Cybersecurity, Blockchain, Energy Efficiency, Digital Healthcare, and Machine Learning. The second speaker was a talented APU Cybersecurity student, passionate about the intersection of technology and law. After a productive networking session, each speaker had a dedicated 45-minute slot to present on a topic of their choice. This event provided a fantastic opportunity for attendees, whether they were students or seasoned professionals, to learn, interact, and expand their professional network.

Thank you to everyone who participated in making this event a success!
