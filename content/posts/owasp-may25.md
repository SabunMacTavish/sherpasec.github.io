SherpaSec teamed up with OWASP Malaysia for a May meetup that brought together cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and students for a focused session on the evolving landscape of AI security. The event featured expert talks from F5 and Kaspersky, covering critical topics tied to the secure deployment and forensic analysis of AI systems.

Foo-Bang Chan, representing F5, delivered a talk on "Securing AI Deployment: Overcoming Challenges in Security," where he outlined the real-world obstacles organizations face when integrating AI into production environments, and how to mitigate associated risks. This was followed by Ahmad Zaidi Said from Kaspersky, who presented "AI Enhanced Forensic Analysis of Web Application Attacks," showcasing how machine learning models are being leveraged to strengthen incident response and attribution. The meetup served as a platform for both technical learning and community engagement.

Thank you to everyone who joined us and contributed to the success of this event.
