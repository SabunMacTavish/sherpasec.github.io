Our eighth community meetup has concluded successfully, gathering cybersecurity enthusiasts for an engaging exchange of knowledge and collaboration. Our first speaker was a senior lecturer and Deputy Dean Undergraduate from UM's Faculty of Law, with interests in Cyberlaw, legal education, and the law of contract. With a focus on navigating the complex intersection of technology and law, she brought valuable insights into the legal aspects of digital activities. The second speaker was a passionate APU Cybersecurity student focused on offensive security, with a keen interest in the intersection of technology and law, showcasing talent and dedication in navigating these dynamic fields. After a productive networking session, each speaker had a dedicated 45-minute slot to present on a topic of their choice. This event provided a fantastic opportunity for attendees, whether they were students or seasoned professionals, to learn, interact, and expand their professional network.

Thank you to everyone who participated in making this event a success!
