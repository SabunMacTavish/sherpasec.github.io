Our fifteenth community meetup successfully brought together cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts for another insightful session of knowledge sharing and discussion.

Holland Sam opened the evening with a talk titled "From Checklists to Creativity: The Differences in Approach Between Pentesting and Red Teaming," offering a thoughtful comparison of methodologies and mindsets in offensive security. He was followed by Firdaus, who delivered an honest and reflective presentation, “Doing and Failing: Another Side of Web CTF,” highlighting the value of persistence and learning through hands-on challenges.

The event also offered time for informal conversations and networking, providing attendees with the chance to exchange ideas and experiences.

Thank you to everyone who joined us and helped make the session a meaningful one.
