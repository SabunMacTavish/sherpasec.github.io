Our sixteenth community meetup wrapped up successfully, bringing together cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts for an engaging evening of learning and discussion.

Muhammad Ali, an experienced cybersecurity consultant, opened the session with a talk on "Bug Hunting in WordPress Plugins," where he shared practical techniques for identifying and addressing plugin vulnerabilities. He was followed by Nelson Lee, a cybersecurity student with a keen interest in wireless security, who spoke on "Maintaining Access to WPA2 Enterprise on Non-Compliant Devices," offering valuable insights into real-world challenges in enterprise environments.

The event also included time for networking, allowing attendees to connect, exchange ideas, and build new professional relationships.

Thank you to all who joined us and contributed to another meaningful session.
