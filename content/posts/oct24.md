Our fourteen community meetup was an inspiring event, bringing together cybersecurity enthusiasts for a lively exchange of ideas and experiences. We were excited to introduce our lineup of speakers for this session. Our first speaker, Mr. Firdaus Khairuddin, Lead Cybersecurity Consultant at Bluesify, presented "Introduction to Web Pentesting & LekirFramework," sharing essential insights into web penetration testing techniques. Following him, Naufal Jaffri, President of GMI CySec, delved into the topic "Transparent DNS Proxy: Double-Edged Sword?" discussing the complexities and implications of DNS proxies in cybersecurity.

Thank you to everyone who participated in making this event a success!
