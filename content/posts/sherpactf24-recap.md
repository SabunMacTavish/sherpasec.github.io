SherpaSec hosted SherpaCTF 2024, a Jeopardy-style Capture the Flag (CTF) competition with a unique Hackathon twist, from November 23-24, 2024, at the Dell Global Business Center in Cyberjaya, Malaysia. The event brought together Malaysia's brightest cybersecurity minds for 24 hours of intense problem-solving, challenges, and innovative presentations. It aimed to unite cybersecurity professionals and students from across the country, identify top talent for international competitions, provide sponsors with direct access to these talents, and contribute to the growth of Malaysia's cybersecurity community.

Participants were divided into two categories: Open, which allowed anyone with a valid Malaysian identity card, and Student, open to students with a valid student ID from a Malaysian educational institution. The event lasted a full 24 hours, offering an opportunity to compete in solving cybersecurity challenges while also developing and presenting solutions.

The competition featured a variety of challenge categories, including Web, Cryptography, Boot2Root, Reverse Engineering, and Miscellaneous. What set SherpaCTF apart from traditional CTFs was its incorporation of a Hackathon element. Teams were required to create slide decks or other media to showcase the solutions they developed for the challenges. These presentations were evaluated by a panel of industry veterans who provided on-the-spot feedback for improvement.

SherpaCTF 2024 concluded successfully, and we would like to thank everyone, sponsors, judges, participants, crews, and challenge creators for making this event possible. This event could not have been achieved without your support.

We express our sincere gratitude to all the sponsors, Dell, Div0, Kotex, ArmourZero, MoneyLion, OffSec, PentesterLab, N0H4TS, and VerdeSec for their generous contributions to the success of this event.
