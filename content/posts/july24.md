Our eleventh community meetup was an exciting event, bringing together cybersecurity enthusiasts for a dynamic exchange of knowledge and collaboration. We were thrilled to unveil our lineup of speakers for the occasion. Our first speaker discussed "Creating an AI Assistant AKA How to Burn Your CPU," providing insights into the creation of a digital assistant with AI.

The second speaker covered "Fraud Detection - Account and Transaction Risk Score," focusing on AI's role in mitigating financial risks. The talk briefly addressed NFP, NSRC, and efforts to build a fraud detection solution, including challenges with data and label verification, model tuning, and scoring accounts and transactions.

Between the two speaker sessions, there was a short talk on "Introduction to ISC2 Malaysia Chapter," offering insights into this important professional community. After a productive networking session, each speaker had a dedicated 40-minute slot to present on their chosen topic. This provided a fantastic opportunity for attendees, whether they were students or seasoned professionals, to learn, interact, and expand their professional network.

Thank you to all who attended and contributed to making this event a success!
