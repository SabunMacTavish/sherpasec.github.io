Our tenth community meetup was an exciting event, gathering cybersecurity enthusiasts for a vibrant exchange of knowledge and collaboration. We were thrilled to have distinguished speakers for this occasion. Our first speaker, a Senior Analyst from Sunway Group, delved into a day in the life of offensive and defensive security teams. The presentation emphasized the pivotal role participants play in securing and shaping the digital future, highlighting the journey from learning and engagement to the active protection of digital infrastructure. Our second speaker, a Computer Networking and Security student, provided a comprehensive guide to the structure and functions of security operations centers. This presentation detailed the essential teams, tools, and skills necessary for effective cyber defense. Following a productive networking session, each speaker had a dedicated 45-minute slot to present their topic. This event offered a fantastic opportunity for attendees, whether they were students or seasoned professionals, to learn, interact, and expand their professional network.

Thank you to all who attended and contributed to making this event a success!
