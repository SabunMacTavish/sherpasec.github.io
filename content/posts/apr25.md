Our seventeenth community meetup at Multimedia University, Cyberjaya concluded on a strong note, bringing together cybersecurity professionals and students for an in-depth session focused on malware and threat research.

The event was held in collaboration with [Malware Village](https://malwarevillage.org/) and featured two expert-led talks. Fareed Radzi, a security researcher at Kaspersky, presented "From Malware to APTs: A Beginner's Guide to Threat Intelligence Workflows," where he walked attendees through the core processes involved in threat analysis and APT tracking. This was followed by Ukasyah Mohd Azlan, Junior Malware Analyst at WithSecure, who shared his findings on "Oliver Stealer: In-depth Analysis of Low Detection Browser Stealer," providing a technical breakdown of how this malware operates and evades detection.

The session also allowed time for networking and open discussion, giving participants the chance to connect and exchange insights.

Thank you to everyone who attended and contributed to making this meetup a valuable experience.
