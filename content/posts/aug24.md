Our twelfth community meetup was an inspiring event, bringing together cybersecurity enthusiasts for a lively exchange of ideas and experiences. We were thrilled to introduce our lineup of speakers for this session. Our first speaker was a talented student with a deep passion for cybersecurity competitions, who presented on "CTFs: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."

Following that, we had an experienced professional who shared critical insights on "Why Criminals Are a Step Ahead."

Thank you to all who participated in making this event a success!
