Our thirteen community meetup was an inspiring event, bringing together cybersecurity enthusiasts for a lively exchange of ideas and experiences. We were thrilled to introduce our lineup of speakers for this session. Our first speaker, Jeff Sandhu, the Chief Operating Officer, shared critical insights on "Hack the Future: Cultivating Cybersecurity Innovators through Peer Learning."

Following that, Zhi Ren, a talented CTF Pwn Player, presented on "Finding the Fun in Pwn."

Thank you to all who participated in making this event a success!
