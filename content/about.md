Persatuan Keselamatan Siber Teknologi Malaysia: PPM-015-16-08102018

We started as a small group of like-minded individuals, driven by a shared passion for learning and collaboration. Over time, our community has grown, welcoming new members who share our vision for creating a space where knowledge flows freely and opportunities for growth abound.

At the core of our community are our sharing sessions, where professionals and students come together to exchange ideas and insights. These sessions feature presentations by one professional and one student speaker, offering unique perspectives on various topics. Beyond presentations, we're committed to fostering deeper engagement through workshops and interactive sessions, empowering participants to learn practical skills and co-create innovative solutions.

Our goal is simple: to connect, learn, and grow together, shaping the future through shared knowledge and collaboration.

We're happily open to new and interesting ideas for the future events anytime, welcoming input from all members as we continue to evolve and expand our community. Join us on this journey of discovery and mutual support as we embrace innovation and strive for excellence in everything we do.
