SherpaSec has supported several cybersecurity conferences in the past and has sponsored members of the security community to attend these events.

# [SINCON](https://www.infosec-city.com/)
SINCON is an annual, premier cybersecurity conference that brings together leading experts from both the East and West to discuss in-depth technical topics and insights, aimed at advancing the region's cybersecurity capabilities. In addition to the main conference, SINCON offers specialized training courses, seminars, and workshops throughout the year. The event is closely tied to Division Zero (Div0), an inclusive cybersecurity community, working together to foster a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem in Singapore. Formerly known as Infosec In the City, Singapore (IICSG), SINCON continues to be a key platform for collaboration and knowledge-sharing in the field.
