# SherpaCTF
SherpaCTF is a Jeopardy-style Capture the Flag (CTF) competition with a unique Hackathon twist designed to bring together cybersecurity enthusiasts, professionals, and students for an intense, 24-hour challenge. Participants will solve a variety of cybersecurity problems across different categories, including Web, Cryptography, and Reverse Engineering. What sets SherpaCTF apart is the emphasis on presentation skills, where teams will present their solutions and receive feedback from a panel of industry experts. This event provides a valuable opportunity to foster talent, promote knowledge-sharing, and connect sponsors with emerging cybersecurity leaders.

In 2024, SherpaCTF was successfully held at the Dell Global Business Center in Cyberjaya, Malaysia, attracting hundreds of enthusiastic participants from the cybersecurity community.
